# Week 1 Thursday Exercise: Google Drive and Discord Collaboration

1. Log into RIT's Google Apps site (http://google.rit.edu), go to the Drive section, and select the "Shared With Me" option in the left sidebar. You should see a folder for your group (e.g. "IGME.110.2018 Group X"). If you don't see it, let your professor or TA know that there's a problem. 

2. Right-click the group folder, and from the drop-down menu choose "Add to My Drive". (You may also want to "Star" the folder to make it easier to find, since Google Drive can be confusing to navigate.)

3. Open the Week 01 Notes document inside the folder, and add some notes from this week's lectures. If other members of your group have already entered notes, you don't need to replicate them--instead, you can add to them, edit them, format them, etc. There doesn't need to be a lot of content, but when we look at the version history for the file (File->Version History->See version history), we should see some evidence of meaningful partcipation by you. 

4. In a different browser tab, open discord. https://discordapp.com/

5. Find your group's private channel; it should show up in the channel list on the left side. If you don't see a private channel with your group's number, it's because we couldn't find you on Discord when we set them up early Thursday morning; ask Professor Willoughby or Rahul to add you now.

6. Configure your Discord notifications. You can change the overall settings for the Discord, and then you can override the global settings on a channel-by-channel basis by right clicking a channel and muting it. I normally will configure my notifications to only notify me of @mentions, which will include people @mentioning you by name or @mentioning @everyone. You're welcome to set it up in whatever way works best for you. (However, since the #announcements channel is used only by the professor and TA for class-wide announcements, it's probably a bad idea to mute that channel!)

***If you have an iOS or Android mobile device, I highly recommend installing the Discord app so that you don't have to be in front of a computer to get notifications! The Discord desktop app is also nicer to use than the web based version.***
